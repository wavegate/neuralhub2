<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hi, there. I'm Frank Lee, and I'm a Master's student in computer science with particular interests in human-computer interaction, educational technology, and the brain-machine interface. I'm a nontraditional student: I studied neuroscience in college, have an MD with a focus in neuropsychiatry, and was a postdoctoral researcher investigating the neural-electrode interface. I have a passion for learning and work as a tutor for students in the natural sciences.</p>
